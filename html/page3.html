<div class="textblock"><p>By inspection it is impossible to see if some computer code is correct, unless the intended functionality is explained in detail. The only exceptions are functions for which the name of a function gives a precise definition of iots functionality. However, even for supposedly precise things like mathematical functions, differing conventions force us to document the detailed functionality of any such implementation regarding the supported types, range of validity, and its error handling. Hence, fully self-documenting code is almost as rare as Yetis or Bigfoots.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Literate"></a>
Literate programming</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>The language in which we express our ideas has a strong influence on our thought processes. </p><div id="author"> Donald E. Knuth </div> </blockquote>
<p>Literate programming <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Knuth:Literate">[12]</a>, is a total departure from the traditional way of writing computer programs. Traditionally, the computer programs are written in a style and order dictated by the computer. Higher level programming languages have only mitigated the inherent strangeness of the source code to some degree. Literate programs are written like the text of an essay or a thesis, using ordinary human language intercepted by pseudo code using macro definitions to hide traditional source code. In this way, the code is embedded in the documentation, and not the other way around as in Javadoc. The train of thought leading to the code, is in the focus of attention.</p>
<p>The programmers writes a literate source file. Using a literate programming tool the literate source file is split into a documentation file "woven" from the source, and a "tangled" software code ready to be compiled.</p>
<p>Writing a literate program is much like writing a thesis. One is forced to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program. Any poorly thought-out design decisions are exposed in plain language, and hence, literate programming leads to higher-quality programs. It also leads to better documentation created along with the program and not as an afterthought. The powerful macro system also allows the reader to view the program on many different scales, from a one-page pseudo-code overview of a large system, to the inner details of a detailed computation, and on all scales the thoughts are presented in plain human language.</p>
<p>Donald Knuth, who first conceived the literate programming paradigm, and coded the first tools for literate programming, was so sure about the quality of his TeX <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Knuth:TeX">[11]</a> and Metafont programs that he offered a cash reward <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Knuth:AllQuestions">[13]</a> for those who found coding errors.</p>
<p>Now, the quality of TeX as software may have more to do with the programmer, than with literate programming, but my personal experience in writing a literate program in a commercial setting supports the Knuth's claim that it results in better software. While it took a little longer than usual to complete the first alfa version, it turned out that there were almost no bugs, and hence, the total development time was less than expected. The end result was one of the best programs I ever wrote, despite the fact that it was my first literate program.</p>
<p>There are three important disadvantges faced by literate programming. </p><ol>
<li>
Software managers generally oppose such a radical change in programming methodology. </li>
<li>
Most programmers prefer to work they way they are used to./li&gt; </li>
<li>
The IT department does not like the idea of having to support new tools. </li>
</ol>
<p>And if you make it pass these three obstacles, the programmers will have to learn how to use a literate programming tool and how to write literate programs. In the end, the programmers may be the worst obstacle. I know programmers who keep boasting about never having read any books at all. This does not promise much for literate programming, I think.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ExtractableDocs"></a>
Extractable documentation</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. </p><div id="author"> Eagleson’s Law </div> </blockquote>
<p>The second best form of documenting code is by means of extractable code documentation. Doxygen <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Doxygen">[21]</a> is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources. It is an excellent tool which can extract the code structure from undocumented source code. The programmers can expand the documentation by adding explanatory text, mathematical formulae and even figures and illustrations. Naturally, the generated documentation is bound to be structured closely along the lines of the code. It does not become a freely flowing text as one can make with literate programming. Nevertheless, extractable documentation is probably the best one can hope for in most organizations.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="WhtDocument"></a>
Why document</h1>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self. </p><div id="author"> Damian Conway </div> </blockquote>
<p>Sometimes one hears that the code should be self-documenting. Good naming of classes, functions and variables, uniform naming conventions and consistent programming style aids in the readability of the code. However, for code to be used across various branches of knowledge, words that have an obvious meaning to the programmer, may be less transparent to others. I remember a bug-ridden geological fault modelling software sometimes resulting in segmentation faults. A structural geologist, familiar with all forms of geological faults, was puzzled by this strange kind of faults. This example goes to the point I was making about the need to define words so that they are understood across all academic disciplines. Normally this cannot be done in code alone, without the help of documentation texts and references to books and scientific articles.</p>
<p>A programmer typically knows thousands of functions in hundreds of classes while in the middle of a programming project. As the code is written, it is fairly obvious how things work. But come back five years later, and try to add a new feature to the system. Now the code is much less transparent. When you find yourself in this situation, you will praise the presence of good code documentation. </p>
