<div class="textblock"><p>The saying goes </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>To err is human, to forgive is devine </p>
</blockquote>
<p>but computers are not human, and users are not devine, so never expect to get away with bugs. To make things worse the general public even ignores the fact that computer systems are human made.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Mariner"></a>
Mariner 1</h1>
<p>Even the smallest human error can have catastrophic consequences in computer software. In the Mariner program NASA launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars, Venus, and Mercury. In 1962 the Mariner 1 spacecraft failed during take-off due to a software bug <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Clarke:Promise">[3]</a>. During transcription from <em>hand-written</em> formulae, the writer of the specification document for the guidance software missed the superscript bar in \(\bar{\dot{r}}_n\). Without the averaging indicated by the bar, the steering program tried to correct for every minor velocity variation. All the spurious corrections sent the rocket off course <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Neumann:RD89">[16]</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Mercury"></a>
Project Mercury Fortran error</h1>
<p>The Project Mercury was the United States' first man-in-space program. In the Mercury project, writing </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">DO 17 I = 1. 10 </div></div><!-- fragment --><p> instead of </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">DO 17 I = 1, 10</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> in the Fortran code of an orbit calculation program could have caused another disaster had not the error been detected in time. To the eye, the difference is just a matter of comma or period, perhaps just a pixel of difference on the computer screen, but to the compiler it is the difference between a variable assignment <code>DO 17 I=1.10</code> or a loop over 10 index values. Deep inside a critical software package, such punctuation errors could have fatal consequences. Fortunately, this particular error was fixed before causing any harm.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Phobos"></a>
Project Phobos 1</h1>
<p>In September 1988 the Russian Phobos 1 Mars orbiter was lost due to systsem shutdown caused by an error in a software command uploaded in the begginning of the month. The proofreading software was malfunctioning at the time, so the operator transmitted the command without proofreading. As a result, the spacecraft received an end-of-mission command <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_HM:RPE">[8]</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Ariane"></a>
Ariane 5</h1>
<p>On June 4th 1996 an Ariane 5 rocket crashed due to a data conversion from a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value which lead to arithmetic overflow <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Ariene5:Flight501Failure">[14]</a> and ultimately to total loss of guidance and altitude information. The rocket and its cargo were valued at $~500 millions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Patriot"></a>
Patriot missile</h1>
<p>Computer errors have also caused loss of lives. One example occured in February 1991 when a Patriot missile struck an American Army barracks, killing 28 soldiers and injuring around 100 other people. The cause has been traced back to accumulation of arithmetic errors in time calculations <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_Skeel:RoundoffErrorPatriot">[19]</a>. Mutiplying the internal clock time in tenths of seconds by 0.10 s/(tenths of s) to obtain seconds failed because of a truncation error. The problem is that while 0.1 has a finite decimal expansion, the expansion in binary numbers is infinite. In the 24 bit register of the Patriot, the error is about 0.000000095 s/(tenths of s). After 100 hours up time, the internal clock had ticked </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ 100 \;\text{h} \times 60 \;\text{min/h} \times 60 \;\text{s/min} \times 10 \;\text{(tenths of s)/s} = 3600000 \;\text{tenths of s}. \]
</p>
<p> After this time the error had accumulated to </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ 3600000 \;\text{tenths of s} \times 0.000000095 \; \text{s/(tenths of s)}= 0.34\;\text{s}. \]
</p>
<p> This is enough time for the missile to travel more than half a kilometre and certainly enough to hit the wrong target.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Sleipner"></a>
Sleipner A disaster</h1>
<p>In August 1991 the Sleipner A oil and gas platform sank after one of the cell walls in the supporting shafts sprang leak. The accident was ultimately caused by serious errors in a finite element analysis software <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_SleipnerA:JR">[10]</a>. The calculations underestimated the shear stresses by 47% in the walls of the supporting base cells <a class="el" href="citelist.html#CITEREF_SleipnerA:Arnold">[1]</a>. Sixteen lives were lost and the material loss was estimated to $700 millions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Lesser"></a>
Less serious failures</h1>
<p>While not every computer error leads to catastrophic effects, I am sure you have experienced irritating computer failures which have cost you time and money. For developers it is particularly annoying when your own code fail to work due to bugs in legacy code. Debugging and patching unfamiliar code is both time-consuming and risky, and may even lead to introduction of new bugs. Hence, it is in everyone's interest that software developers focus more on robustness and correctness and employ methods to reduce the risk of bugs to a minimum. </p>
